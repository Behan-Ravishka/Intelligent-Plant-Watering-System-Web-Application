# 🌱 Intelligent Plant Watering: A Sensor-Driven System for Sri Lanka's Green Thumbs

This project is a First-Year Collaborative Mini Hardware Project developed as part of the CHWP (Collaborative Hardware Project) module by a team of six undergraduate students. Our goal was to address the problem of water and fertilizer inefficiency in agriculture through a smart, sensor-based solution.

## 📌 Project Overview

The "Intelligent Plant Watering System" is a low-cost, automated irrigation solution that uses real-time sensor data to monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and fertilizer (NPK) levels. The system dynamically adjusts water delivery using a drip irrigation setup to reduce water waste and improve plant health. A supporting web application provides remote access to sensor data via live charts and allows farmers to generate reports for better decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Primary:** Automate plant watering using soil moisture sensor data
- **Secondary:** Monitor NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) levels for optimal fertilizer use
- **Overall Goal:** Improve resource efficiency and crop yield using affordable sensor-based technology

## 🧠 Key Features
- Real-time sensor data collection: Soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and NPK levels
- Automated irrigation based on live data
- Data logging for future analysis and decision-making
- Wi-Fi-based remote monitoring (ESP32 + SQLite)
- LCD for local environmental feedback

## 🔧 Technologies & Hardware Used
- **Microcontrollers**: Arduino UNO, ESP32
- **Sensors**: Soil moisture sensor, NPK sensor, temperature & humidity sensors
- **Database**: SQLite3 (remote server integration)
- **Display**: LCD for user feedback
- **Power**: External power supply to support all components
