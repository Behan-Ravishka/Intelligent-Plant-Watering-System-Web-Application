# 🌱 Intelligent Plant Watering: A Sensor-Driven System for Sri Lanka's Green Thumbs

## 📌 Overview
This is a Year 1 Mini Collaborative Hardware Project developed under the CHWP module. The system is designed to automate plant watering based on real-time sensor data, helping to reduce water and fertilizer waste in Sri Lankan agriculture.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Primary:** Automate plant watering using soil moisture sensor data
- **Secondary:** Monitor NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) levels for optimal fertilizer use
- **Overall Goal:** Improve resource efficiency and crop yield using affordable sensor-based technology

## 🧠 Key Features
- Real-time sensor data collection: Soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and NPK levels
- Automated irrigation based on live data
- Data logging for future analysis and decision-making
- Wi-Fi-based remote monitoring (ESP32 + SQLite)
- LCD display for local environmental feedback

## 🔧 Technologies & Hardware Used
- **Microcontrollers**: Arduino UNO, ESP32
- **Sensors**: Soil moisture sensor, NPK sensor, temperature & humidity sensors
- **Database**: SQLite3 (remote server integration)
- **Display**: LCD for user feedback
- **Power**: External power supply to support all components
